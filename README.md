Data Science projects completed during my time as a Data Science intern at Codsoft

1. Titanic Survivor Prediction:
    In the titanic problem I was tasked with analyzing the titanic passenger dataset and to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger would have      survived or died. 
2. Sales Prediction:
    In the sales problem I was tasked with analyzing the sales_advertising dataset and to build a machine learning model to predict how much you spend on which     
    advertising medium would yield  which amount of sales.
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
    In the credit card fraud problem I was tasked with analyzing the credit_card transaction dataset and to build a machine learning model to predict whether a     
    particular transaction is fraudulent or not.
