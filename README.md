# CODSOFT Data Science Projects

This repository contains three data science projects completed during my time as a Data Science intern at Codsoft.

## Project 1: Titanic Survivor Prediction
In the Titanic Survivor Prediction project, I analyzed the Titanic passenger dataset and built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger would have survived or died. The goal was to explore the factors influencing survival rates and develop a predictive model to understand passenger demographics related to survival.

### Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning (classification algorithms)
- Model evaluation and validation

### Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

### Results and Insights
- Identified key factors affecting survival rates such as age, gender, and ticket class.
- Achieved an accuracy of 81.52% on the test dataset with the developed model.
- Visualized survival patterns and demographic insights through graphs and charts.

## Project 2: Sales Prediction
The Sales Prediction project involved analyzing the sales_advertising dataset and building a machine learning model to predict how much spending on different advertising mediums would yield in terms of sales. The objective was to identify the most effective advertising channels for maximizing sales revenue.

### Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sales and advertising data
- Machine learning (regression algorithms)
- Model evaluation and optimization

### Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

### Results and Insights
- Predicted sales based on advertising spending with an RMSE of 1.27.
- Identified that most influential advertising medium for generating sales is TV.
- Visualized relationships between advertising spending and sales revenue.

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
For the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I analyzed the credit card transaction dataset and developed a machine learning model to predict whether a particular transaction is fraudulent or not. The aim was to detect and prevent fraudulent activities using predictive modeling techniques.

### Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of transaction data
- Machine learning (anomaly detection algorithms)
- Model evaluation and validation

### Technologies Used
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

### Results and Insights
- Built a fraud detection model with an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset.
- Identified patterns and anomalies in credit card transactions.
- Visualized fraudulent transaction trends and patterns for analysis.
